# Cherry Blossom

Cherry Blossom is an iTunes style media player for the Haiku Operating System.
Cherry Blossom is a 100% native application and does not try to be portable to any
other operating system. Cherry Blossom uses Haiku specific API's for handling media,
so if Haiku can play your media files, then Cherry Blossom will also be able to play your files.
